# Anki_Project

This is a program which utilises the chatgpt API and the google cloud TTS API to create language learning flashcards in Anki. The flashcards follow the principle of Productive cards and Receptive cards as described by S. A. J. Forbes in "How to Teach Yourself a Foreign Language". The flashcards contain dictionary definitions (in the foreign language) as well as audio for the foreign words and phrases. This program has been successfully tested on a dataset containing ~4500 Italian words.
